        "Here, we're plotting the average amount of reward received by the agent. This is because plotting the optimality on this many tests gets too crowded and noisy. As can be seen, the agent with an epsilon of `0.1` was the one that received the most amount of reward. Values of epsilon that are too small take very few exploratory actions, and therefore take a long time to explore and find the most optimal value. On the other hand, values of `epsilon` too high will obstruct the capacity of the agent of acting optimally. Too much exploration gets in the way of exploitation."
